##  12 WEEKS IN UGANDA

In this project I tried to explored with the idea of creating a travel blog using my past travel experience. 

#  UX

This website target is for people who are looking to get into traveling and seeing the world but are unsure of leaving their confort zone. It targets a narrow range of audience. This case it's for young adults looking to take a gap year or time off to explore.
